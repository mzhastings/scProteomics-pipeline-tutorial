# Quantification with FlashLFQ + PIP-ECHO

## Step 1: Run FlashLFQ on PSMs
- Input: `psm.tsv`
- Ensure correct column mappings (mass, RT, etc.)

## Step 2: PIP-ECHO
- Use consistent protein ID propagation

> Reference: *Improved detection of differentially abundant proteins through FDR-control of peptide-identity-propagation*
